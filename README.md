# Oregon State Beavers 2019 Football Preview

## Description
This project gives a brief overview of the Oregon State Beavers' football season for 2019. Specifically, a roster breakdown is given by player grade and position, along with more detailed charts of how many players are in each position by grade. A chloropleth map is also displayed, which shows how many players are from each state (Note: This map only shows players from the United States). Another map is shown, which is a flow map of the distance from Oregon State to the locations of every opponent, with orange arrows representing distance from opponents traveling to Corvallis and black arrows representing distances for away games. A few more charts are displayed at the end, which visualize miles to travel and opponent rank for each game, Pac 12 wins over the last six years for each team in the Pac 12, and points scored and points allowed by the Beavers for each game during the 2018 season. Leaflet was used to create the maps, and C3 and D3 were used to create the charts. This project was assembled using Webslides.
